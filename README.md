- 👋 Hi, I’m @Butters56777
- 👀 I’m interested in programing and coding a variety of different useful tools and things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, honestly just trying to get the basics down, but HTML or something like that at first.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, currently not a lot, but after I get more into how this works then sure, small steps first.
- 📫 How to reach me, send me a message through my email, Splatman002@gmail.com and Ill get to you as soon as I can or message me on here.
